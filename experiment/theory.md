 
🔷 What is Amplitude Modulation (AM)?
Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a modulation technique in which the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the message signal (modulating signal), while the frequency and phase remain constant.

🔷 Types of Amplitude Modulation:
There are several types of AM, but two important ones used in this experiment are:

🔹 1. DSB-FC (Double Sideband Full Carrier) Modulation:
In DSB-FC, both the upper and lower sidebands are transmitted along with the carrier.

 .

🔹 2. SSB (Single Sideband) Modulation:
In SSB, only one sideband (either upper or lower) is transmitted. The carrier and the other sideband are suppressed.

This reduces bandwidth and power consumption.

Spectrum: Contains only one sideband (either

  or

 ).

Types of SSB:

SSB-SC: Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier

SSB-FC: Single Sideband with Full Carrier (less common)

🔷 Modulation Index (Modulation Factor)
The modulation index (or modulation factor) in AM is a measure of the extent of modulation applied to the carrier signal.

🔹 In terms of waveform (using CRO):
