1. Amplitude Modulation (AM) :
Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication to transmit information over a carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal, which contains the information to be transmitted.

2. Double Sideband Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM):
In Double Sideband Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM), both the upper and lower sidebands are transmitted along with the carrier signal. The modulated signal can be mathematically expressed as:

$ s(t) = [A_c + m(t)] \cos(2\pi f_c t) $

where:

s(t) is the modulated signal,
Ac is the amplitude of the carrier,
m(t) is the modulating signal,
fc is the frequency of the carrier.
The DSB-AM signal contains two sidebands:

Upper Sideband (USB): 
Lower Sideband (LSB): 
The presence of both sidebands means that DSB-AM is less efficient in terms of bandwidth and power usage, as both sidebands carry the same information.

3. Single Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SSB-AM)
Single Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SSB-AM) is a more efficient form of amplitude modulation where only one of the sidebands (either the upper or lower) is transmitted, eliminating the carrier and the other sideband. This results in a significant reduction in bandwidth and power consumption.

The SSB signal can be represented as:

$ s(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t) - A_m \sin(2\pi f_m t) \sin(2\pi f_c t) $

This representation shows that SSB modulation effectively conveys the same information as DSB but occupies less bandwidth.

4. Modulation Factor
The modulation factor (or modulation index) is defined as the ratio of the peak amplitude of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier signal:

$ m = \frac{A_m}{A_c} $

Where:

m is the modulation factor,
Am is the peak amplitude of the modulating signal,
Ac is the amplitude of the carrier signal.
A modulation factor of $m < 1$ ensures that the modulated signal does not distort, while $m = 1$ represents 100% modulation. If $m > 1$, distortion occurs, leading to signal degradation.

Summary
In summary, DSB-AM and SSB-AM are two important techniques in amplitude modulation. DSB-AM transmits both sidebands and the carrier, while SSB-AM transmits only one sideband, making it more efficient. Understanding the modulation factor is crucial for ensuring optimal performance in communication systems.
