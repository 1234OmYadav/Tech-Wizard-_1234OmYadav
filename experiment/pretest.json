      "question": "What is the main purpose of Double Sideband Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To transmit information by varying the amplitude of a carrier wave",
        "b": "To transmit information by varying the frequency of a carrier wave",
        "c": "To transmit information without modulation",
        "d": "To transmit information by varying the phase of a carrier wave"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! DSB-AM varies the amplitude of a carrier wave to transmit information.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This describes Frequency Modulation (FM).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Modulation is essential for transmitting information.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This describes Phase Modulation (PM)."

      "question": "In DSB-AM, which components are present in the modulated signal?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only the carrier signal",
        "b": "Upper Sideband (USB) and Lower Sideband (LSB)",
        "c": "Only the Upper Sideband (USB)",
        "d": "Only the Lower Sideband (LSB)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The carrier signal is not the only component.",
        "b": "Correct! DSB-AM includes both USB and LSB.",
        "c": "Incorrect. DSB-AM includes both sidebands.",
        "d": "Incorrect. DSB-AM includes both sidebands."

      "question": "What is the modulation factor in amplitude modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The ratio of the peak amplitude of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier signal",
        "b": "The frequency of the carrier signal",
        "c": "The total power of the modulated signal",
        "d": "The bandwidth of the modulated signal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The modulation factor is defined as the ratio of the peak amplitude of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier signal.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The frequency of the carrier signal is not the modulation factor.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Total power is not related to the modulation factor.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Bandwidth is not the modulation factor."

      "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of Single Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SSB-AM) over DSB-AM?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "SSB-AM uses less bandwidth",
        "b": "SSB-AM is easier to implement",
        "c": "SSB-AM transmits both sidebands",
        "d": "SSB-AM requires more power"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! SSB-AM uses less bandwidth compared to DSB-AM.",
        "b": "Incorrect. SSB-AM is generally more complex to implement.",
        "c": "Incorrect. SSB-AM transmits only one sideband.",
        "d": "Incorrect. SSB-AM is more power-efficient."

    {
      "question": "What happens if the modulation factor exceeds 1 in amplitude modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The signal becomes distorted",
        "b": "The signal is transmitted without any issues",
        "c": "The carrier signal is lost",
        "d": "The bandwidth increases significantly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A modulation factor greater than 1 leads to distortion in the signal.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Exceeding the modulation factor leads to issues.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The carrier signal is not lost but distorted.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Bandwidth does not necessarily increase with distortion."
