### Procedure for the Experiment: DSB/SSB Amplitude Modulation and Parameter Determination
1. Setup the Equipment
Signal Generator: Set up a signal generator to produce a carrier wave at a specific frequency (e.g., 1 MHz).
Modulating Signal Source: Connect an audio source (e.g., a function generator) to generate a modulating signal (e.g., a sine wave at 1 kHz).
Modulator Circuit: Use a diode modulator for DSB-AM and a balanced modulator for SSB-AM.
Oscilloscope: Connect an oscilloscope to visualize the modulated signals.
Power Supply: Ensure that all equipment is powered and properly connected.
2. Perform DSB-AM Modulation
Adjust Signal Levels:

Set the amplitude of the carrier signal (
) to a fixed value (e.g., 5V).
Adjust the amplitude of the modulating signal (
) to a desired level (e.g., 1V).
Modulate the Signal:

Activate the DSB modulator circuit.
Observe the output waveform on the oscilloscope. You should see the carrier wave with both upper and lower sidebands.
Measure Amplitudes:

Use the oscilloscope to measure the peak amplitudes of the carrier signal (
) and the modulating signal (
).
Calculate Modulation Factor:

Calculate the modulation factor using the formula: 
 
 
3. Perform SSB-AM Modulation
Switch to SSB Modulator:

Change the modulator circuit to implement SSB modulation.
Adjust Signal Levels:

Ensure the same amplitude settings for the carrier and modulating signals as in the DSB-AM setup.
Modulate the Signal:

Activate the SSB modulator circuit.
Observe the output waveform on the oscilloscope. You should see only one sideband (either USB or LSB) without the carrier.
Measure Amplitudes:

Measure the peak amplitude of the modulating signal (
) and the carrier signal (
) again.
Calculate Modulation Factor:

Calculate the modulation factor for SSB using the same formula: 
 
 
4. Analysis and Comparison
Compare Waveforms: Analyze the waveforms of DSB-AM and SSB-AM on the oscilloscope. Note the differences in bandwidth and power usage.
Discuss Results: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of DSB-AM and SSB-AM based on the observed results and calculated modulation factors.
5. Documentation
Record all measurements, calculations, and observations in a lab notebook.
Include screenshots of the oscilloscope waveforms for both DSB-AM and SSB-AM.
